<h5><p>	This is my secondary school friends. They are 20 years old.They are always there for me.
They know everything about me.They are who will help me if I has facing any problems.  
They always gave me advises about information of Islam and in education. They taught me more about how to be a good muslim.  
I learned more things from them. I can't imagine if they leave me alone. I don't know what happen to me if I not met them. 
It's hard to find a friend like them that always remind us about prayers, aurah, recite Quran and more.</p>
<p>	Now, they had their own studies journey. We can meet if all of us are have leisure time. But, because of this pandemic situation
we cannot make a reunion. Actually we had planned various activities when we are on semester break but have to postpone.  
Hopefully, Covid-19 will disappear and everyone can move anywhere or vacation anywhere without fear and worry. I really miss our moments together ;( </p>
